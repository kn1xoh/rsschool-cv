## About me

I create layouts of varying complexity with adaptation to any device.

- Use flex, grid, BEM, pixel-perfect
- Know how to use the Sass preprocessor (variables, mixins, imports), I can do simple animation
- Create custom website controls in JavaScript (selects, accordions, tabs, etc.)
- Can connect third-party JS libraries (for sliders, modal windows)
- Use Gulp to automate the layout process (converting images to avif, webp, minifying code, converting to Sass, autoprefixer, etc.)

I regularly study and consolidate my knowledge on pet projects. I am truly driven by teamwork on a joint project, I want to be part of the development of websites, services that people will use. I am ready to work hard to become a useful specialist in a short time!
